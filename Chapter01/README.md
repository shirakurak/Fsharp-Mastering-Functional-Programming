# Getting Started With F#

## Introduction to F# and its key features

- what F# is
- key features

F#: powerful programming language
combines with

- elegance and expressiveness of functional programming
- .NET platform

> F# offers a unique and refreshing approach to writing software

F#

- functional-first programming language
  - run on the .NET platform
  - for developing a wide range of applications
    - web
    - desktop app
    - machine learning
    - cloud-based systems

- consise syntax
- strong type inference

allows you

- clean
- maintainable
- efficient
- expressive

key features: focus on functinal programming principles

functional programming

- computation as the evaluation of mathematical function
- emphasizing imuutability
- pure function
- avoid side effect

â†’ easier to reason about, test, maintain

key features

1. consise and expressive syntax
2. strong type inference
3. immutable data
4. higer-order functions
5. pattern matching
6. interoperability with .NET
7. Asynchronous and parallel programming

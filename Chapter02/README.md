# Functional Programming Principles

## Introduction to functional programming concepts

### immutability

once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed

### pure function

given the same inputs, always produce the same output

### use of higher-order function

function that can take other functions as parameters or return functions as results

> They enable abstraction and composition

### Function Composition

## Immutable data and value immutability

## Pure functions and side effects

## Higher-order functions and function composition

## Pattern matching and recurstion

## Understanding immutability and its benefits
